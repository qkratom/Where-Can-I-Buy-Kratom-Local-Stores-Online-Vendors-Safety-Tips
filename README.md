## Understanding Kratom and Its Legal Status

**Kratom** (Mitragyna speciosa) is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia, where its leaves have been used traditionally for centuries. The plant contains naturally occurring alkaloids, primarily mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, which interact with the body's receptors in unique ways.

### Current Legal Landscape

The legal status of kratom remains complex and varies significantly by jurisdiction:

**Federal Level**: Kratom is not federally scheduled in the United States, making it legal at the national level. However, the FDA has not approved kratom for any medical uses and continues to monitor its safety profile.

**State and Local Regulations**: Several states and municipalities have implemented their own restrictions:

- **Banned states**: Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin
- **Age restrictions**: Some states require buyers to be 18 or 21 years old
- **Regulated states**: States like Florida and Nevada have specific labeling and testing requirements

> 🚨 **Important**: Always verify current local laws before purchasing kratom, as regulations can change frequently.
